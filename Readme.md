## Problems/Fixes

Refreshing the page generates a new unique code. Make sure you are giving both your browser, and the app itself microphone and camera permissions. Clearing the site's cookies and refreshing the page, or using a different browser should fix most issues.  
## Run Locally

install dependencies in both the root directory(server) and client folder. You should have two sets of node_modules folders.


***Then, in the root directory, run:*** 


```bash
yarn run dev
```
Concurrently and nodemon will start both the client and server and app will be live on localhost:3000
